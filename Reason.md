# Why does this matter?
## AI is becoming too advanced.

When you look at certain videos on YouTube for example, you will start to realize not only the video is AI, whether it be art or a completely made up TV show, but all of the comments are AI as well.

I think that this goes to show how far advanced AI actually is. It's very interesting that a lot of people are using this to profit off YouTube revenue. It's pretty much passive income. I think that since AI is such a new thing, there needs to be rules and regulations to go against this. AI art for example should not be able to be monetized. I think this goes against creativity.
