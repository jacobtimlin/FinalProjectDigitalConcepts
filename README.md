# FinalProjectDigitalConcepts
This is a Markdown Page about AI for the Digital Concepts final. 

By Jacob Timlin

I wanted to create this markdown page tutorial to tell people about AI. A lot of people don't realize how advanced AI is becoming, and it's really interesting. I didn't know how advanced it was until I took a class last year that showed AI deep fakes, which are insane to me. You could be in a meeting with people, but they are all AI and phished you via email to join the meeting to reveal vulnerable data.
